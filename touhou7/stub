REQUIREMENTS:
- Original JP Touhou 7 game directory any version 1.00-1.00b (English pre-patched one may not work!)
- System JP locale enabled (https://web.archive.org/web/20240126214334/https://www.visualnovelwiki.org/en/general/jp-locale - your distro may not be listed in there, but do your own research to figure out how to). Pay attention to the Lutris Flatpak configuration if you are using it!

THIS INSTALLER PROVIDES:
- Run ZUN patches to update the game to the latest version
- vpatch
- Latest thcrap
- A batch helper script to manipulate thcrap created launch shortcuts

HELPER SCRIPT EXPLANATION - This installer script also includes batch script that does the following:
- Look for all *.lnk file in Desktop directory
- Enumerate found .lnk from 1 to n and ask user for input in choosing the .lnk
- If chosen .lnk has 'custom' in it (meaning it is the game configuration tool), it will open it immediately. This allows you to edit the game config.
- If chosen .lnk does not have 'custom' (meaning it is launch shortcut for the game with patches), it will set that .lnk as the main game executable for Lutris.

The reason for this is Lutris requires a static location for the main game executable, but patching creates a different set of shortcuts each time you create a patch stack. The solution is to have a script that help you choose which shortcut is the main game executable. This also means that Steam Deck users can dynamically choose between patches and enter game configuration tool or run patch configuration all within the Flatpak Lutris launch options in Desktop mode without having to manually edit by hand.

TROUBLESHOOTING/FAQ:
- If you have no sound, toggle 'Prefer system library'.
- Closing thcrap configuration tool or the main game executable creates a hanging process, this is annoying but fortunately a non-issue, just click 'Stop' in Lutris to force close background processes. This also affects Steam Deck game mode, simply tap B when quitting game to force close background processes.
